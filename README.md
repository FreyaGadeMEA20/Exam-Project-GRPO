# Exam-Project-GRPO
First semester university exam project for GRPO.

For my first semester project for GRPO, i decided to create the combat system from Pokémon.

In the game there are two Pokémon. Your Pokémon and an Enemy Pokémon you have to defeat. Use your Pokémon moves to defeat the enemy Pokémon and win the fight.

The program is very simple from the users perspective, as there are 4 buttons, where the user can click on a move to use that move. Then a combat sequence occurs, where some sound plays and the pokemon duke it out. 
This continues until one of the Pokémon has reached 0 or less hp, where the game then ends and will have to be restarted.

All music, sounds and sprites for the Pokémon are owned by the Pokémon Company.
